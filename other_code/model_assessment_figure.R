# Model assessment figures
# Author: Mary Lofton
# Date: 03APR25

# Purpose: four panel figure, first two panels are pred vs obs across all spp, second
# panel is quantile of pred distribution that obs falls into across all spp;
# also supplemental figures that break it out by spp
# ends up being four panels because focusing on two models, delta-env and N-species
